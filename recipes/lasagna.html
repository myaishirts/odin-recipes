    Instructions
    Prepare the Meat Sauce:
    Cook the Meat:
    
    Heat olive oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until the onion is translucent.
    Add the ground beef and pork (or sausage) and cook until browned. Drain excess fat if necessary.
    Add Tomatoes and Spices:
    
    Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce.
    Add the basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.
    Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:
    Make the Roux:
    
    In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
    Add the flour and stir constantly for about 2 minutes to form a roux.
    Add Milk and Seasoning:
    
    Slowly whisk in the milk, continuing to stir until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes.
    Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
    Prepare the Ricotta Mixture:
    Mix Ricotta and Egg:
    In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, and Parmesan cheese.
    Mix until well combined and smooth.
    Cook the Lasagna Noodles:
    Boil Noodles:
    Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
    Assemble the Lasagna:
    Preheat Oven:
    
    Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
    Layer the Ingredients:
    
    Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
    Place a layer of noodles over the sauce.
    Spread a portion of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.
    Pour a layer of béchamel sauce over the ricotta.
    Sprinkle a layer of mozzarella cheese.
    Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce, béchamel, and mozzarella on top.
    Bake the Lasagna:
    Cover and Bake:
    
    Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.
    Uncover and Finish Baking:
    
    Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.
    Rest Before Serving:
    
    Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
    Tips for Success
    Flavor Enhancement: For an extra flavor boost, add a splash of red wine to the meat sauce while simmering.
    Vegetable Addition: Add sautéed mushrooms, spinach, or zucchini to the layers for added nutrients and flavor.
    Cheese Variety: Feel free to mix different types of cheese, such as fontina or provolone, for a unique taste.
