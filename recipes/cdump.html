<h1>Chicken Dumplings</h1>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<h2>For the Dumpling Filling:</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground chicken</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated</li>
            <li>2 green onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped cabbage (optional)</li>
    </h3>
</ul>
<h2>
    For the Dumpling Wrappers:
</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>
        <li>1 package of store-bought dumpling wrappers (or make your own if you prefer)</li>
    </h3>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Filling:

        In a large bowl, combine ground chicken, minced garlic, grated ginger, green onions, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and black pepper. If using cabbage, add it to the mixture.
        Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are well incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the Dumplings:

            Take one dumpling wrapper and place a teaspoon of filling in the center.
            Wet the edges of the wrapper with water using your finger.
            Fold the wrapper over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Press the edges together to seal, ensuring no air is trapped inside. You can pleat the edges for a more traditional look if desired.
            Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.</li>
            <li>Cook the Dumplings:

                You can either steam or pan-fry the dumplings.
                To Steam:

Place the dumplings in a steamer basket lined with parchment paper or cabbage leaves (to prevent sticking).
Steam over boiling water for about 10-12 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked.

                </li>
                <li>To Pan-Fry:

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.
Place the dumplings flat side down and cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.
Carefully add 1/4 cup of water to the skillet and cover with a lid. Let them steam for another 5-7 minutes, or until the water evaporates and the dumplings are cooked through.</li>
<h1>Crunchy Garlic Chili Sauce</h1>

        Finish the Sauce:

Add soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, sesame seeds, and salt to the garlic oil.
